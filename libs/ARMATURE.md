# ArmatureJS

TODO: Examine how ArmatureJS can be split into multiple modules

THOUGHT: If e.g. the helper lib stuff can be broken down into their own discrete modules then there can be discrete dependance

THOUGHT: How to ensure stability across versions

THOUGHT: Can the current module implementation be used within the context of this project - using webpack or whatever
