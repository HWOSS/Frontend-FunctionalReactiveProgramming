# Front-end Functional Reactive Programming
Exploring the paradigm of functional reactive programming as a tech stack

## Technologies
#### ES2015
Program in the present; compile down to what browsers need to digest; polyfill where required

#### RxJS ([ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/))
Asynchronous and event-based reactive programming library

#### ReactJS ([React](https://facebook.github.io/react/))
DOM abstraction; one-way binding; UI library


## Run

` npm install `

` npm start `

` localhost:3333 `

## Aims

- Explore the paradigm of functional reactive programming in the context of front-end development
- Explore the separation of concerns, MVC?
- How much can be pure ECMAScript with libraries essentially being polyfills/shims
- Can this be a feasible implementation in different contexts
  - Creation of flat markup for backend integration
  - SPA builds
  - Semi-native device applications
- Explore testing solutions
- Explore routing solutions
- Explore build pipelines
- Aim to keep API area to a minimum; application of concepts
- Don't want this to be yet another framework
- Limit dependencies
